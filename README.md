connect-autoreload
-----------------

connect-autoreload is connect middleware that supports a basic javascript client.  The server watches for file changes and the client reloads your page when files are changed.  This is useful if you're a frontend developer and you're sick of manually refreshing the page to reflect your changes.

## Standalone reload script

If you're looking for the easiest way to refresh your page when files change, check out [autoreload](https://github.com/typpo/autoreload).  If you want to integrate the autoreload behavior into your own connect/express server, read on.

## Installation

`npm install connect-autoreload`, or add connected-autoreload to your package.json.

## Setup

See the standalone app in `example/`.  Edit the config, start the server (`node path/to/app.js`), drop in the js, and you're good to go.

### Adding autoreload to an existing server

If you already have an express app, it's easy to add autoreload middleware:

    var autoreload = require('connect-autoreload')

    var config = {
      watch_dirs: 'js html css/compiled thirdparty/frontend',
      ignore_regex: /\.sw[poax]$/,
    };

    app.use(autoreload(config));

This will set up the default endpoint, `waitForReload/`.

It's recommend to start the node app from your project's root directory.  That way, `watch_dirs` will correctly work with relative paths.  `examples/start.sh` is a shorthand for this if you use git.

### Including the Javascript client

`<script src="http://localhost:60000/autoreload.js"></script>` or include `js/autoreload.js` on your page.

To start reloading the page when changes happen, call `AutoReload.Watch()`. If you run your autoreload server at a different host/port as your page is served from, it can be set as parameter, like `AutoReload.Watch(''http://localhost:60000')`.

You can call `AutoReload.Stop()` at any point to cancel the refresh-on-change behavior.

## https setup

If your web server requires an https connection, your connect app must have a valid cert or your browser will choke.

If you are running a separate web server, it might be annoying to set up the dummy autoreload node app with your cert.  Instead, you can proxy via Apache or nginx -

Example Apache config using ProxyPass:

    ProxyPass /waitForReload http://localhost:60000/waitForReload

Example nginx config:

    location /waitForReload {
      proxy_pass      http://localhost:60000/waitForReload
    }
